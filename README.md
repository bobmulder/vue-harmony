# Vue Harmony

## Introduction

Harmony in music is fascinating. Since I've watched a lot of videos of Jacob Collier and read the book "Theory of Harmony" by Ernst Levy, I started practicing on my piano.

Being a developer made me think how to quickely get the negative chord. Doing this by hand takes some time, why can't we 'calculate' this?

This tool is experimental to see how we can provide real time info about harmony when playing on a MIDI device.
